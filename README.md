# Senioritis-Android-App

The Senioritis Application is meant to provide its users with clear, digestible information about the disease known as Senioritis.
A typical user experience would include navigating through the topics, reading the information provided, and filling out a 6-question testing quiz. The quiz will try to determine whether that individual has Senioritis based on how they answered.

There are two methods on how to open and run the application

--1st Method with Android Studios--
1) To Download Andriod Studios
2) Unzip the Senioritis-App.rar
3) Open the file in Andriod Studio and hit the play button in the top toolbar to run the Application.

--2nd Method with Android emulator --
1) Download a Android emulator like BlueStacks
2) Run the APK file with BlueStacks or with your Android Emulator

This Application project was created with Eric Loureiro in our Android Design Class. We created this application using what we learned in class using Andriod Studios. 

I hope you enjoyed our Senioritis Application!
